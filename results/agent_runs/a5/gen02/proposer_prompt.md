You are a valuation researcher. Comparable-company valuations ("comps") are reported as ranges,
and practitioners' ranges are badly calibrated. Your job is to discover short, interpretable rules
that say HOW UNCERTAIN a comps valuation is for each US non-financial firm, so its range can be
wide where comps are unreliable and narrow where they are reliable.

TASK
Propose exactly 6 NEW range rules (generation 2): 3 for EV/EBITDA and 3 for EV/Sales.
Rules are scored only on exploration years FY2016-2019. The best rule per multiple will later be
tested ONCE on later years you will never see, so prefer rules with a clear economic reason over
fragile tweaks. A practitioner should be able to read your rule and apply it by hand.

RULE LANGUAGE
A range rule gives every target firm-year a positive UNCERTAINTY SCORE s. Only the relative
ranking of s across firms matters: the grader converts scores into ranges by calibration.

  s = BASE x exp( sum_j w_j * (pct_j - 0.5) ) x (product of `times` for every condition that holds)

  base:        one of ['constant', 'peer_iqr', 'peer_range']
               "constant" = 1; "peer_iqr" = the peers' log interquartile spread (floored at 0.05);
               "peer_range" = the peers' log max/min spread (floored at 0.10)
  terms:       up to 4 {INPUT: weight}, weight a non-zero number in [-3.0, 3.0].
               pct_j is the firm's percentile rank (0-1) on that input WITHIN its fiscal year, so
               weight +1.0 makes the top firm's score e^1 = 2.7x the bottom firm's. Missing = median.
  conditions:  up to 4 {"if": [clause, clause?], "times": t}, t in [0.25, 4.0], t != 1.
               All clauses (1 or 2) must hold. A clause is a FLAG {"var": "loss_making"} or a
               continuous input with exactly one threshold {"var": X, "below_pct": P} or
               {"var": X, "above_pct": P}, P an integer 5-95 (within-year percentile).
               A missing input makes the clause false.
  The constant band alone (base "constant", no terms, no conditions) is not a valid proposal.

INPUTS (accounting characteristics of the target, statistics of its peers, and flags; the
target's own market value, price or multiple is never available)
  - log_sales: log of sales (size)
  - log_assets: log of total assets (size)
  - sales_growth_1y: 1-year sales growth
  - sales_growth_3y: 3-year annualized sales growth (missing for FY2016-2017: not enough history)
  - gross_margin: gross profit / sales
  - ebitda_margin: EBITDA / sales
  - ebit_margin: EBIT / sales
  - net_margin: net income / sales
  - roic: EBIT x (1 - 25%) / (equity + debt - cash)
  - roe: net income / book equity
  - asset_turnover: sales / total assets
  - net_debt_to_ebitda: (debt - cash) / EBITDA
  - debt_to_assets: total debt / total assets
  - rnd_intensity: R&D / sales
  - capex_intensity: capital expenditure / sales
  - peer_iqr: log(75th / 25th percentile) of the 10 peers' multiples: how much the peers disagree
  - peer_range: log(max / min) of the peers' multiples
  - n_peers: number of peers found (10 unless the sector is thin)
  - loss_making: FLAG: net income < 0
  - negative_ebitda: FLAG: EBITDA <= 0 (only possible for EV/Sales; EV/EBITDA needs positive EBITDA)
  - no_history: FLAG: no prior-year sales in the data (recent listing or new to the sample)

HOW RANGES ARE SCORED
  Point estimate: the median EV multiple of the target's 10 nearest peers (same 2-digit SIC;
  nearest on size and EBITDA margin) times the target's EBITDA or sales. e = ln(actual EV /
  point estimate), actual EV on June 30 after the fiscal year.
  Calibration on the other years: centre c = median e; q = 80% conformal quantile of |e - c| / s.
  Range: point x exp(c - q s) to point x exp(c + q s). So every rule covers ~80% overall; a good
  rule puts wide ranges on firms that are truly hard to value and narrow ranges on easy ones.
  Interval score (lower is better) = width + 10 x distance outside the range, in logs.
  Exploration score: leave-one-year-out over FY2016-2019 (calibrate on 3 years, score the 4th).

ARCHIVE: your earlier graded attempts, exploration scores only (2 graded)
  [g01-01] EV/EBITDA interval score 2.591 | coverage 80.0% | median range x/2.03
      EV/EBITDA | base constant | terms log_sales -1, rnd_intensity +0.6, sales_growth_1y +0.4 | if loss_making x1.4
      by firm type: loss_making 80%, smallest_20pct 81%, fastest_growing_20pct 81%, highest_rnd_20pct 83%, fallback_or_few_peers 73%
      mechanism: Small firms and R&D-heavy firms derive much of their value from intangible growth options that current EBITDA does not capture, so the peer EBITDA multiple is a poor anchor; their thin analyst coverage and illiquidity add pricing noise. Loss-making firms with positive EBITDA have earnings that are transitory or burdened by below-EBITDA charges, making the EBITDA base itself unreliable.
  [g01-04] EV/Sales interval score 4.556 | coverage 79.9% | median range x/2.91
      EV/Sales | base constant | terms ebitda_margin -1, log_sales -0.8 | if negative_ebitda x1.6 | if loss_making x1.2
      by firm type: loss_making 91%, smallest_20pct 90%, fastest_growing_20pct 81%, highest_rnd_20pct 89%, fallback_or_few_peers 73%
      mechanism: EV/Sales implicitly assumes the target converts sales into cash flow like its peers; firms with low or negative EBITDA margins are valued on a turnaround or option value that sales alone cannot reveal, so their actual EV can sit far above or below the peer-implied level. Small firms add illiquidity and coverage noise on top.

Each proposal needs:
  - "mechanism": the economic reason these firms' market values are harder (or easier) to pin
    down with comps (2-3 sentences)
  - "prediction": a falsifiable expectation, e.g. "interval score below the constant band's"
  - "rule": the rule object
An independent referee, who sees your mechanism but no scores, will reject proposals without a
specific economic reason, or near-copies of earlier rules (e.g. one weight changed slightly).
